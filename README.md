# Connect-Four-

## Written Reflection
</p>1. This project did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach the design and problem solving process for this project? </br>
- The framework for the design of the project started by building a table based on the technical requirements given. The table contained the classes we thought of, the methods each class was going to have, and the expected return per method; the table was a visual that guided the whole coding process, and having agreed on it, and updating it when needed, it even helped us in the refactor process.</br>
- The technical guidelines for the Battleship project were also read to support the design.</br>
- Tools you used: Terminal, Pry, VS Code, Ruby-docs, Blogs, Chat GPT, Classmates, Mentors and Instructors.</p>
</p>2. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?</br>
- We really wanted to develop the two human players feature suggested in iteration 4, and also some refactor.</br>
- We also were interested in creating the ruby gem to install the game everywhere.</p>
</p>3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.</br>
- We worked mostly using driver and navigation style, rotating over each feature to perform the roles as evenly as possible.</p>
</p>4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.</br>
- It was almost in real time when coding, as we both were sharing ideas to solve the encountered problems and also the debugging needed.</br>
- We supported each other, acknowledging we're human beings and it's been a pleasure for both to work together.</p>
